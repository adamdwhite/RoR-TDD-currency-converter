Test Driven Development (TDD)

1. Write test 
2. Run test -> test fails 
3. Write code to make the test pass 
4. Run test -> test passes 
5. Refactor the code 
6. Run test -> test should still pass! 
7. (Rinse, Repeat)



Instructions for continuing work on in-class demo:

1. Add tests for checking type of parameters passed into initialize. "currency_one" and "currency_two" should be strings. And "conversion_rate" should a number.

2. Add tests for checking type of paramter "amount" for both conversion methods. It should be a number.

3. The if-else in the convert_currency_two_to_one method needs to be tested. The if else gives you two different sceanrios that can happen and they both need to be tested.
